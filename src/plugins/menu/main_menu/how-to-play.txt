The following is a very brief explanation of the controls:

You move around with WASD and zoom in and out with the scroll wheel.
Press Space to reset the zoom level.

Use the number keys to select the buildings.
They are relatively self-explanatory, but here is another list:

- Belts
- Splitters, split a belt into two
- Combiners, combine two belts
- Crafter, crafts items
- Miner, mines resources
- Furnace, smelts raw materials, needs coal inputted to the side
- Tunnels, can transport items under other belts
- Buffer Chests, buffers items and outputs them to the buildings around it

The buildings can be rotated with R and F.

The goal of the game is to produce a helicopter using the available resources. The recipes can be seen when opening clicking on a crafter or furnace
